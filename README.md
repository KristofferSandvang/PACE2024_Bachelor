# One-Sided Crossing Minimization in Two-Layered Bipartite Graphs

This repository contains our, Kristoffer Sandvang and Mateusz Filipowski, progress for the implementation of a solution for the [PACE 2024 challenge](https://pacechallenge.org/2024/) on the heuristic track. Our final submission to the PACE 2024 challenge can be seen [here](https://github.com/KristofferSandvang/PACE2024).

## Dependencies 
The dependencies for the Python code can be found in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). They can be installed using pip by using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tests
To determine the most effective tie-breaking method for the median and barycenter heuristics in minimizing edge crossings and trying to determine conditions where one heuristic is better, we have performed tests. Using tests graph generated by PACE, that can be found [here](https://pacechallenge.org/2024/). To generate the figures used in our bachelor thesis, you can chose to generate your own data, or use the preexisting data in [`solvers.csv`](./solvers.csv).

### How to generate data

In order to generate test data run generateSolverData.sh using:
```
sh generateSolverData.sh
```

This command will run all the solvers on all the test graphs from ```"./tests/graphs/allGraphs"``` and save the results in [`Solvers.csv`](Solvers.csv). Keep in mind that this will take a very long time and there is no need to run this as we have done it for you. However, if you wish to test this on your own machine, you should delete the [`Solvers.csv`](Solvers.csv) file and run the above command.

### How to generate the plots
To generate the plots used in our thesis, you run the python program [`solvers.py`](solvers.py) by using this command:

```
python3 solvers.py
```

## Compute a permutation of the nonfixed layer
To compute a permutation of the nonfixer layer in a graph, you can simply run the script `Solver.sh`:
#### For MacOS/Linux:
```
./Solver.sh path/to/graph.gr
```
#### For Windows:
```
sh Solver.sh path/to/graph.gr
```
### Visualize
To visualize a graph using the [PACE 2024 visualizer](https://pacechallenge.org/2024/visualizer/), you can use the option `-v` to run the script. For example:
```
./Solver.sh -v ./tests/graphs/tiny/website_20.gr
```
### Count crossings after
To count the crossings a graph using the [PACE 2024 verifier](https://pacechallenge.org/2024/verifier/), you can use the option `-c`. For example:

```
./Solver.sh -c ./tests/graphs/tiny/website_20.gr
```
